# CWaggle
CWaggle Robot Simulator

See main.cpp for brief tutorial

Run `make` from the cwaggle root directory to build 3 executables in the bin directory:

- cwaggle_exaple: drag circles / lines around to demonstrate physics
- cwaggle_orbital: demo of Andrew Vardy's orbital construction algorithm
- cwaggle_rl: demo of our reinforcement learning orbital construction algorithm

Run either program to see a demo of the cwaggle system

Inspired by the JS Robot simulator 'Waggle' by Andrew Vardy
